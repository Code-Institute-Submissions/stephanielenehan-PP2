To whom it may concern, I wish to respectfully acknowledge that whilst this submission is technically a resubmission, that it is wholly incomplete to date. I have effectively started over on the project and have based my new code on my own learnings and using Love Maths walkthrough as a guide. I last attempted the course prior to ADHD diagnosis and treatment over the last year during which time I did not code at all. 

Whilst I am disappointed not to have completed this project in time and will have to work hard to complete it now before final grading, I am nonetheless pleased with the development process so far and look forward to completing the project. I have chosen to leave the original code of my first attempt at the project commented out below the code I am developing now. I appreciate that this might be fine for my own development that it should not be present in a final submission. 



## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

The Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock website is an online game for both adults and children where they can play the computer in a chance game. 

Users of this website game are able to play online via desktop, tablet or mobile device by clicking or tapping on simple graphic icons.

This game is targeted at adults and children given that it has simple unwaivering rules.

Underneath the play area is the rules listed. 

The font compliments the icons and is in keeping with the fun attitude of the game. 

The bright colors used are in keeping with the fun attitude of the game whilst providing good contrast between the font and backgrounds.

The deployed site functions reflecting the random functionality of a computer or opponent choice. This randomness being reflected in the fact that sometime the computer will choose the same hand twice as someone might do in real life. 

## Bugs (old site based off old out of date you tube tutorial)


I had issues in getting the images to show and resolved the bug with correction of code 

The incorrect code was:

## Lighthouse (new site under development from scratch)  

Accessibility whilst under development was scoring highly across all criteria under I recently added the buttons to HTML which don't have an accessible name yet.

## Credits

### Content (old site based off old out of date you tube tutorial)

### I based the code that appears commented out in my project off of a you tube tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding. 
    It can be found here https://youtu.be/fIBOydve2f8
    It has some old out of date practices that need to updated. 

### Content (new site under development from scratch)     
I have endeavoured to write as much of my own code as possible using the Love Maths Walkthrough as my general guide. 
   
### Media (old site based off old out of date you tube tutorial)

### I used images for rock, paper and scissors from the following sources: 

Rock https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-4.jpg

Paper https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-3.jpg

Scissors https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-5.jpg

### Media (new site under development from scratch)

Old jpeg images for the Rock, Paper, Scissors choices have been replaced with font awesome icons instead for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock.

This I found a cleaner and more accurate way to progress as I can make the icons into buttoms and effectively target with CSS classes / ids and with the future development of the JavaScript. 

I have left the old jpeg images in my images folder for the moment until I decide whether I will reuse them at all in any other way elsewhere in the project or delete them altogether.
