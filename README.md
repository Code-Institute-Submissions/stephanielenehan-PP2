## Rock Paper Scissors

The Rock Paper Scissors website is an online game for both adults and children where they can play the computer in a chance game. 

Users of this website game are able to play online via desktop, tablet or mobile device by clicking or tapping on simple graphic icons. 

The game provides responsive actions to the players choices in a random fashion so as to mimic the unknown choice of an opponent when playing the game. 

Players are given 3 choices to choose from with each having a possible outcome of win, lose or draw. 

This game is targeted at adults and children given that it has simple unwaivering rules. 

The future development of this game will be Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock giving players 5 choices to choose from.
