The deployed site functions reflecting the random functionality of a computer or opponent choice. This randomness being reflected in the fact that sometime the computer will choose the same hand twice as someone might do in real life.

### Content (old site based off old out of date you tube tutorial)

### I based the code that appears commented out in my project off of a you tube tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding. 
    It can be found here https://youtu.be/fIBOydve2f8
    It has some old out of date practices that need to updated. 

### Content (new site under development from scratch)     
I have endeavoured to write as much of my own code as possible using the Love Maths Walkthrough as my general guide. 
   
### Media (old site based off old out of date you tube tutorial)

### I used images for rock, paper and scissors from the following sources: 

Rock https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-4.jpg

Paper https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-3.jpg

Scissors https://icon-library.com/images/spock-icon/spock-icon-5.jpg

### Media (new site under development from scratch)

Old jpeg images for the Rock, Paper, Scissors choices have been replaced with font awesome icons instead for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock.

This I found a cleaner and more accurate way to progress as I can make the icons into buttoms and effectively target with CSS classes / ids and with the future development of the JavaScript. 

I have left the old jpeg images in my images folder for the moment until I decide whether I will reuse them at all in any other way elsewhere in the project or delete them altogether.
